          <p>We at Altris AI are passionate about data and annotation quality.</p>
          <p>We know that the best AI solutions on the market are developed by experts who understand in-depth problems that AI should detect. Each image that we use for AI training is carefully annotated by a Retina Specialist, as well as reviewed and verified by two experienced Retina Experts before commencing any experiments with AI.</p>
          <p>That is why our algorithm shows an exceptional level of accuracy when determining pathologies and pathological signs. That helps ophthalmologists and optometrists to make better decisions and have higher diagnostic standards altogether.</p>
